It supports the following features:
- Live reporting on a Neo4j database with a table, graph view, bar chart or line chart.
- Support for reporting on Neo4j data types, including nodes, edges, paths, as well as aggregate types.
- Setting auto-refresh intervals for each report.
- Customizing your dashboard layout with a variety of report sizes.
- Saving/loading dashboards as a JSON dump.
