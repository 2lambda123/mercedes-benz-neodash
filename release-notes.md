## NeoDash 2.2.0
This release marks the official arrival of **[Extensions](https://neo4j.com/labs/neodash/2.2/user-guide/extensions/)**, which provide a simple way of extending NeoDash with additional features. Adding your own features to NeoDash just became a lot easier!

NeoDash 2.2 comes with three in-built extensions.
- **Rule-Based Styling**
- **Advanced Visualizations**: These provide a means to enable complex visualizations in a dashboard. These were previously available as Radar charts, Treemaps, Circle Packing reports, Sankey charts, Choropleth and a Gauge Chart).
- **Report Actions**: Which let you create interactivity in dashboards, using the output of one report as input for another visualization. (Pro Extension)

You can enable extensions by clicking the ðŸ§© icon on the left sidebar of the screen.

Other changes include:
- New example dashboards available in the [Dashboard Gallery](https://neodash-gallery.graphapp.io).
- Customizable background colors for all report types.
- Fixing a bug where the Choropleth map chart was unable to parse country-codes.
